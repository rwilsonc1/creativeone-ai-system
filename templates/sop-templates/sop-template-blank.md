# SOP Template — Blank Skeleton

> **How to use this template:** This is the structural skeleton for every CreativeOne SOP. Claude should use this as the starting framework when building a new SOP, filling in each section according to the rules in `sop-pattern-guide.md` and the examples in the `sop-example-*.md` files. Sections marked `[IF APPLICABLE]` are conditional — include them when the criteria described are met.

---

| SOP Title | [Department] — [Category] — [Process Name] |||
|---|---|---|---|
| Owner | [Role title] | Version | v1.0 |
| Last Updated | [MM/DD/YYYY] | Cadence | [Frequency or trigger] |
| Audience | [Who will execute this SOP] | Next Review | [Date — typically 3–6 months out] |
| Reviewed By *(if applicable)* | [Role title of reviewer/approver] | | |

---

## 1. Purpose

[2–3 sentences. First sentence: state the problem or need this SOP addresses. Second sentence: state what following this SOP accomplishes. Third sentence (optional): connect to a broader outcome — system improvement, consistency, risk reduction. Avoid generic purpose statements.]

## 2. Scope [IF APPLICABLE]

[Paragraph 1: What this SOP covers. Be specific about the process boundaries.]

[Paragraph 2: What this SOP does NOT cover. Name specific adjacent processes that someone might confuse with this one.]

## 3. What You'll Need [IF APPLICABLE]

[Bulleted list of prerequisites. Include:]
- [Tool/platform access required]
- [Knowledge or information the executor needs before starting]
- [Estimated time to complete]
- [Any dependencies — other people, other processes, approvals needed first]

## 4. Procedure

### Phase 1 — [Action-Oriented Phase Name]

[Numbered steps. One action per step. Use direct second-person instructions.]

1. [Step]
2. [Step]

[Insert callout boxes at high-risk, commonly confused, or high-value moments. Types:]

> 💡 **Tip:** [Helpful but non-critical guidance]

> ⚠️ **Warning:** [Critical step — skipping or doing this wrong causes a real problem]

> ❌ **Common mistake:** [A specific error the team has seen people make]

> 📋 **[PROMPT/COMMAND NAME] — [copy and customize / use verbatim]:**
> [Exact text to copy]

### Phase 2 — [Action-Oriented Phase Name]

[Continue pattern. Each phase groups related steps under a descriptive name.]

### Phase 3 — [Action-Oriented Phase Name]

[Continue as needed. Most SOPs have 3–6 phases.]

### Final Phase — [Completion / Handoff / Session Close]

[The last phase should always address: What does the executor do when they're done? Where does the output go? Who gets notified? Is there a handoff step?]

[For any SOP that involves a Claude Project session, the final phase should include the Session Close prompt and the learnings handoff to the Marketing Manager via Microsoft Teams.]

## 5. Verification — How to Know It's Done [IF APPLICABLE]

[Checklist format. Each item is a concrete, verifiable completion criterion.]

- ☐ [Criterion 1]
- ☐ [Criterion 2]
- ☐ [Criterion 3]
- ☐ [Criterion 4]

## 6. Troubleshooting

[Minimum 3 rows, maximum 8. Write problems as symptoms the executor would experience.]

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| [Symptom the executor would see or experience] | [Specific, actionable steps to fix it] |
| [Symptom] | [Fix] |
| [Symptom] | [Fix] |
