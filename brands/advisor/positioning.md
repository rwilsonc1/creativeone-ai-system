## The Advisor's Role (As Positioned to Consumers)

The advisor is a **trusted guide** who helps clients navigate complex financial decisions with confidence. They bring experience, knowledge, and a genuine commitment to their clients' wellbeing.

The advisor is **not:**
- A salesperson pushing products
- A guru with secret knowledge
- A gatekeeper to financial success

The advisor **is:**
- An experienced professional who listens first
- A translator who makes complex topics accessible
- A partner in long-term planning, not a one-time transaction
- Someone who's seen many situations like the client's and knows how to help think through them

## Core Messaging Framework

When writing as an advisor to consumers, the messaging should convey:

### 1. "I'm here to help you understand your options."
The advisor educates. They lay out the landscape, explain the trade-offs, and help the client make an informed decision — not a pressured one.

### 2. "Your plan should be built around your life, not around a product."
Goals-first planning. The conversation starts with what the client wants — income, protection, legacy, peace of mind — and works backward to the strategy.

### 3. "You don't have to figure this out alone."
Retirement planning is complex. The advisor acknowledges that and positions themselves as the person who walks alongside the client through it.

### 4. "I've helped people in situations like yours."
Experience and track record (stated in compliant ways) build credibility. The advisor has seen these scenarios before and knows how to think through them.

## Positioning by Content Type

| Content Type | Positioning Focus |
|---|---|
| **Prospecting / lead gen** | "I help people like you think through retirement with clarity and confidence." Educational, not salesy. |
| **Seminar invitations** | "Join me for a conversation about [topic]. I'll walk you through what you need to know." Inviting, educational framing. |
| **Nurture emails** | "Here's something I thought you'd find helpful." Value-forward, building trust over time. |
| **Market update communications** | "Here's what's happening and what it may mean for you." Calm, informed, reassuring. |
| **Client review prep** | "Let's look at where you are and make sure you're on track." Partnership-oriented. |
