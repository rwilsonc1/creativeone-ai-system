## Vertical Context

Annuity advisors help clients use annuity products (fixed, fixed indexed, variable) as part of their retirement income strategy. The primary conversation is about **turning savings into reliable income** and **protecting principal** while still participating in potential market growth.

This is CreativeOne's largest vertical.

## Topic-Specific Language Guidance

### Terms to Explain (Never Assume the Client Knows)
| Term | Plain Language Explanation |
|---|---|
| Annuity | A contract with an insurance company designed to help provide income, often in retirement |
| Fixed Indexed Annuity (FIA) | An annuity that may offer growth potential tied to a market index, with protection against market loss |
| Accumulation phase | The period when your annuity is growing before you start taking income |
| Income rider | An optional feature that can help provide a guaranteed income stream |
| Surrender period | A set number of years where early withdrawal may result in a fee |
| Cap rate / participation rate | Limits on how much market-linked growth you may receive |

### Compliant Framing for Common Annuity Claims
| Topic | Compliant Framing |
|---|---|
| Principal protection | "Designed to help protect your principal from market downturns" |
| Guaranteed income | "May offer the potential for a guaranteed income stream" (note: guarantees are backed by the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company) |
| Market participation | "Offers the potential to participate in market growth without direct market exposure" |
| Tax deferral | "May offer tax-deferred growth, meaning you don't pay taxes on earnings until you withdraw them" |

## Tone Adjustment

Annuity conversations often involve people who are **anxious about outliving their money.** The tone should lean slightly more toward **reassuring and protective** compared to the foundation. The advisor is helping the client feel safe without making promises.

## Common Anti-Patterns for Annuity Content

| Avoid | Better |
|---|---|
| "Your money is guaranteed to grow" | "Your annuity may offer the potential for growth while helping to protect your principal" |
| "You'll never lose money" | "This type of annuity is designed to help protect against market loss" |
| "Guaranteed income for life" (without disclaimer) | "May provide the potential for a guaranteed income stream (guarantees backed by the claims-paying ability of the issuing company)" |
| "This is better than the stock market" | "This approach may offer a different balance of growth potential and protection than direct market investment" |
