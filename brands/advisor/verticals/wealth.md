## Vertical Context

Wealth management advisors provide comprehensive financial planning and investment management for clients with significant assets. The conversation is broader than a single product — it encompasses **investment strategy, tax planning, retirement income, estate planning, and overall financial wellbeing.**

These advisors operate through CreativeOne Wealth (Corporate RIA) and have a fiduciary responsibility to act in their clients' best interest.

## Topic-Specific Language Guidance

### Terms to Explain
| Term | Plain Language Explanation |
|---|---|
| RIA (Registered Investment Adviser) | A firm registered to provide investment advice in your best interest |
| Fiduciary | A legal obligation to act in your best interest, not the advisor's |
| AUM (Assets Under Management) | The total value of investments an advisor manages on behalf of clients |
| Asset allocation | How your investments are spread across different types (stocks, bonds, etc.) |
| Diversification | Spreading investments across different areas to help manage risk |
| Rebalancing | Adjusting your portfolio periodically to maintain your target investment mix |
| RMD (Required Minimum Distribution) | The minimum amount you must withdraw from certain retirement accounts each year after a certain age |
| Tax-loss harvesting | Selling investments at a loss to help offset gains and potentially reduce taxes |

### Compliant Framing
| Topic | Compliant Framing |
|---|---|
| Investment returns | "Seeks to pursue competitive returns" or "designed to help pursue growth over time" — never state specific expected returns |
| Risk management | "Strategies designed to help manage risk" — never imply risk can be eliminated |
| Fiduciary standard | "As a fiduciary, I'm held to a standard that requires me to act in your best interest" — this is factual and can be stated directly |
| Comprehensive planning | "A holistic approach designed to help align your financial strategy with your life goals" |

## Tone Adjustment

Wealth management clients tend to be **more financially sophisticated** than the average retiree audience. The tone can be:

- **Slightly more technical** — These clients may be comfortable with some financial terminology, though plain language is still preferred
- **Strategic** — Frame the advisor as a strategic partner, not just a product provider
- **Holistic** — Always connect back to the bigger picture, not just one investment or account

The fiduciary angle is a real differentiator and can be stated confidently — it's a factual standard, not a marketing claim.

## Common Anti-Patterns for Wealth Content

| Avoid | Better |
|---|---|
| "We'll grow your wealth" | "We work to help build and protect your wealth over time" |
| "Our portfolio outperforms the market" | "We design portfolios with the goal of pursuing competitive, risk-adjusted returns" |
| "You'll never have to worry about money again" | "Our goal is to help you feel confident about your financial future" |
| "We manage your money so you don't have to think about it" | "We manage your investments so you can focus on what matters most to you" |
