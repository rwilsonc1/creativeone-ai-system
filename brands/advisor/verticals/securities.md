# Advisor Voice — Securities Vertical

> Layered on top of `voice-foundation.md` when writing as a securities-licensed advisor/registered representative.
> Only includes adjustments and additions — everything in the foundation still applies.

## Vertical Context

Securities advisors (registered representatives) help clients with investment products including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and variable products. They operate through CreativeOne Securities (member FINRA/SIPC) and are subject to the highest level of regulatory scrutiny.

**Extra compliance caution is required for all securities content.** FINRA regulations are strict about communications with the public.

## Tone Adjustment

Securities content carries **the highest regulatory burden.** The tone should be:

- **Precise** — Word choice matters more here than in any other vertical. Every claim must be defensible.
- **Balanced** — Always present both the potential benefits and the risks. One-sided presentations are a compliance red flag.
- **Disclosure-ready** — Write with the assumption that required disclosures will accompany the content. Leave room for them.

Despite the regulatory constraints, the voice should still be **warm and human.** Compliance and warmth are not mutually exclusive — the advisor is still a trusted guide, just one who is careful with their words.

## Required Disclosures

Securities content typically requires one or more of these disclosures. The specific requirement depends on the content type and products discussed:

- "Securities offered through CreativeOne Securities, member FINRA/SIPC."
- "Past performance is not indicative of future results."
- "All investments involve risk, including the potential loss of principal."
- "Please consult a prospectus before investing."

> **When in doubt:** Flag for compliance review. Securities content has the lowest tolerance for error.

## Common Anti-Patterns for Securities Content

| Avoid | Better |
|---|---|
| "This investment is safe" | "This investment may offer certain features designed to help manage risk, though all investments carry some degree of risk" |
| "You'll earn 8% annually" | "This fund has historically pursued growth, though past performance does not guarantee future results" |
| "This is a sure thing" | Never use. No securities content should imply certainty of outcome. |
| "Better than a savings account" | "May offer the potential for higher returns than traditional savings, though with greater risk" |
