## Vertical Context

Life insurance advisors help clients protect their families and businesses through life insurance products (term, whole life, universal life, indexed universal life). The primary conversation is about **protection, legacy, and financial security for loved ones.**

These conversations are inherently emotional — they involve thinking about mortality, family responsibility, and what happens when someone is gone.

## Topic-Specific Language Guidance

### Terms to Explain
| Term | Plain Language Explanation |
|---|---|
| Term life insurance | Coverage for a specific period of time (e.g., 10, 20, or 30 years) |
| Whole life insurance | Permanent coverage that also builds cash value over time |
| Universal life (UL) | Flexible permanent coverage with adjustable premiums and a cash value component |
| Indexed universal life (IUL) | A type of universal life where cash value growth is linked to a market index |
| Death benefit | The amount paid to your beneficiaries when you pass away |
| Cash value | A savings component within certain life insurance policies that may grow over time |
| Beneficiary | The person or people you choose to receive the death benefit |
| Underwriting | The process the insurance company uses to evaluate your application and determine your rate |

### Compliant Framing
| Topic | Compliant Framing |
|---|---|
| Family protection | "Designed to help provide financial protection for your family" |
| Cash value growth | "May offer the potential for cash value accumulation over time" |
| Legacy planning | "Can be an important part of a strategy designed to help leave a legacy for your loved ones" |
| Estate planning | "May play a role in helping to address estate planning needs" |

## Tone Adjustment

Life insurance conversations require **extra sensitivity.** The advisor is asking clients to think about difficult scenarios. The tone should be:

- **Empathetic** — Acknowledge that this topic is hard to think about
- **Purposeful** — Frame it around love and responsibility, not fear
- **Practical** — Help the client see this as a logical, caring decision, not a morbid one

Avoid fear-based messaging entirely. Never frame life insurance as "what happens if the worst occurs." Frame it as "making sure the people you love are taken care of."

## Common Anti-Patterns for Life Insurance Content

| Avoid | Better |
|---|---|
| "What would happen to your family if you died tomorrow?" | "Life insurance can help make sure your family is taken care of, no matter what" |
| "You need life insurance" | "Life insurance may be worth considering as part of your overall financial plan" |
| "This policy guarantees your family's financial future" | "This policy is designed to help provide financial support for your family" |
| "It's too late if you wait" | "The earlier you explore your options, the more choices may be available to you" |
