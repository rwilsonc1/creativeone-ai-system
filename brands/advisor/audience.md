## Primary Audience: Retirees & Pre-Retirees (55+)

### Demographics
- **Age range:** Primarily 55–75, with some clients in their late 40s (early planners) and 80+ (existing clients)
- **Life stage:** Approaching retirement, recently retired, or navigating early retirement years
- **Income/assets:** Have accumulated meaningful wealth — retirement accounts, savings, home equity, possibly pension or Social Security benefits
- **Education:** Generally educated and capable, but not financial experts. They can understand concepts when explained clearly.

### What They're Thinking About
- Will my money last through retirement?
- How do I turn my savings into reliable income?
- How do I protect what I've built?
- What happens to my family if something happens to me?
- Am I making the right decisions at the right time?
- How do taxes affect my retirement income?
- Should I be doing something different with my investments?
- What's the best way to leave something for my kids/grandkids?

### What They Want from an Advisor
| Need | What It Looks Like |
|---|---|
| **Clarity** | Someone who explains things in plain English, not financial jargon |
| **Trust** | Someone who has their best interest at heart and proves it over time |
| **A plan** | Not just products, but a coherent strategy for their specific situation |
| **Accessibility** | Someone who picks up the phone, responds to emails, and makes them feel valued |
| **Calm in uncertainty** | When markets drop or policies change, they want reassurance backed by knowledge |
| **Respect** | They've worked hard for decades. They don't want to be talked down to or rushed |

### What Turns Them Off
- High-pressure sales tactics
- Jargon-heavy language that makes them feel dumb
- Vague promises without substance
- Feeling like a number, not a person
- Being told what to do without being helped to understand why
- Flashy, over-the-top marketing that feels untrustworthy

## Secondary Audiences

### Spouse/Partner
- Often involved in financial decisions, sometimes as the primary decision-maker
- May have different risk tolerance or priorities
- Content should feel inclusive of couples, not just individuals

### Adult Children
- May be influencing their parents' financial decisions
- Tend to be more research-oriented and digitally savvy
- Sometimes the ones who find the advisor on behalf of their parents

### Business Owners Approaching Exit
- A subset of the pre-retiree audience
- Thinking about succession planning, business valuation, and converting business equity into retirement income
- More complex needs, but same desire for trusted guidance

## Communication Preferences
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Respond to educational content that helps them feel informed and empowered
- Trust is built through consistency, not one-time impressions
- Appreciate a personal touch — their name, their situation, not a generic blast
- Comfortable with email and increasingly with digital content, but not assumed to be tech-savvy
