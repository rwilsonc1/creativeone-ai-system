## Good Examples

### Website Homepage — Voice in Action
The homepage hero line *"Helping advisors take their practice from good to great"* paired with *"Growing your business has never been so easy"* is a good example of the brand voice — confident, benefit-focused, not overpromising. The follow-up *"More than just a partner"* section sets the relationship tone well.

### Securities Page — Proof Points
The Securities page uses specific, verifiable stats rather than vague claims: NPS 144% above industry standard, 98% rep retention, organic growth without M&As. This is the right approach — show, don't claim.

<!-- Add more examples as they come up -->
<!-- Format: ### [Date] — Description -->
