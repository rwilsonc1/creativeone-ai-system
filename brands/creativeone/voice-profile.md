## Key Brand Phrases

These are phrases actively used in CreativeOne's brand messaging:

- **#youbelonghere** — Community-oriented tagline used across marketing
- **"Experience How Different Feels"** — Differentiator messaging on the homepage
- **"More than just a partner"** — Relationship framing
- **"Helping advisors take their practice from good to great"** — Primary homepage headline
- **"We'll always pick up your call, and you'll always know who you're talking to. With us, it's personal."** — Service commitment language

## Voice Description

CreativeOne sounds like a **knowledgeable partner who's been in the room before.** We don't lecture. We don't hype. We speak with the quiet confidence of a team that's built real infrastructure for real advisors over 40+ years and knows what works.

We're warm without being casual. Professional without being corporate. Confident without being arrogant. We respect that our audience is made up of accomplished professionals running serious businesses — we talk to them as peers, not prospects.

The #youbelonghere ethos runs through everything. We're inviting, not exclusive. We make advisors feel like they have a home, not like they've been recruited into a club.

## Tone Spectrum

CreativeOne's tone adjusts by context, but always stays within this range:

| Context | Tone Dial |
|---|---|
| Recruiting / prospecting new advisors | Confident, inviting, opportunity-focused |
| Communicating with existing advisors/agents | Supportive, knowledgeable, partnership-oriented |
| Event marketing (incentive trips, appreciation events) | Warm, celebratory, energizing |
| Educational content (market updates, industry insights) | Authoritative, clear, helpful |
| Product/service announcements | Clear, benefit-focused, practical |

## Do — Always

- **Lead with value, not with us.** Frame messaging around what the advisor gains, not what CreativeOne is.
- **Sound like a trusted partner.** We're alongside them, not above them.
- **Be direct and clear.** Our audience is busy — get to the point without being blunt.
- **Show, don't claim.** Talk about what we do and how we do it. Let the value speak rather than making superlative claims.
- **Use plain, confident language.** Write the way a sharp, experienced colleague talks — not the way a brochure reads.
- **Respect the audience's intelligence.** These are professionals running $5MM–$20MM+ books of business. Don't oversimplify or talk down.

## Don't — Never

- **Don't be salesy or hype-driven.** No "elite," "exclusive," "game-changer," "crushing it," or motivational-speaker energy. That's not us.
- **Don't overpromise.** Even in B2B marketing where compliance rules don't strictly apply, we don't make claims we can't back up. It's a credibility issue.
- **Don't be corporate or stiff.** Avoid jargon-heavy, impersonal language. If it sounds like it came from a legal brief, rewrite it.
- **Don't try to be trendy.** No forced slang, hashtag-driven phrasing, or startup-culture language. We're established and grounded.
- **Don't be vague.** "We help you grow" means nothing. Be specific about what we actually do.
- **Don't punch down at competitors.** We don't need to diminish others to show our value.
