## Key Differentiators

What sets CreativeOne apart from other FMOs:

1. **40+ years and still independent** — Not a startup, not acquired. Decades of industry experience with stability and institutional knowledge.
2. **Full-service in-house marketing agency + MediaOne studio** — Most FMOs offer templates or basic co-op marketing. CreativeOne has a full marketing team building real campaigns, plus an in-house audio/video production studio.
3. **Seminar program with built-in lead generation** — Pre-approved presentations + paid advertising to fill rooms. Advisors show up and present; we handle the rest.
4. **Everything under one roof** — FMO, Broker-Dealer, Corporate RIA, and full marketing agency. Advisors don't need multiple relationships.
5. **Personal relationships at scale** — 160+ employees, many with 20+ year tenures. 98% rep retention. "We'll always pick up your call, and you'll always know who you're talking to."
6. **Business-friendly compliance** — Compliance that works with advisors to get business done, not just say no.
7. **Coaching and mentoring** — Not just products and back-office — business strategy, opportunity identification, and a peer community of successful advisors.

## Messaging Pillars

Use these as the foundation for any CreativeOne B2B marketing content:

### 1. "More than just a partner."
When you work with CreativeOne, you have access to a team of industry experts whose sole purpose is helping you grow your practice. Whether it's marketing, technology, coaching, or just being a friend — we've got your back.

### 2. "Everything under one roof."
FMO, Broker-Dealer, Corporate RIA, in-house marketing agency, audio/video studio. Advisors get comprehensive support without juggling multiple relationships.

### 3. "A real marketing team, not a template library."
Our in-house marketing agency and MediaOne studio build campaigns, run seminar advertising, produce video and audio content, and provide turnkey marketing programs that most FMOs simply don't offer.

### 4. "Experience how different feels."
40+ years, 160+ employees, 98% retention, and we still pick up the phone by the third ring. This isn't transactional — it's personal. #youbelonghere

### 5. "Built for advisors who are building something."
Our ideal partners are experienced professionals running serious practices. We're built to support that level of ambition with infrastructure that matches.
