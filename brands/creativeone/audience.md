## Primary Audience: Independent Financial Advisors & Insurance Agents

### Ideal Advisor Profile

- **Business size:** Running offices bringing in approximately $5MM–$20MM+ per year in annuity business
- **Experience level:** Established professionals, not beginners — they've built a practice and are looking to grow or optimize it
- **Licensing:** Licensed across one or more of: Life Insurance, Annuities, Wealth Management, Securities
- **Independence:** Independent operators or small firms, not captive agents at large carriers
- **Mindset:** Business builders who want infrastructure and support, not hand-holding
- **What they value:** Efficiency, reliability, real support (not just products), and a partner who understands their business

### What They're Looking For in an FMO

| Need | What It Looks Like |
|---|---|
| **Operational efficiency** | Someone to handle case submission, processing, and commissions so they can focus on clients |
| **Marketing support** | Real marketing help — not templates they have to customize themselves |
| **Lead generation** | Programs like seminars that put qualified prospects in front of them |
| **Education** | Market updates, product training, and industry insights that keep them competitive |
| **Breadth** | Support across the products they sell — Life, Annuities, Wealth, Securities — without needing multiple FMO relationships |
| **Relationship** | A partner who knows them, not a vendor who sees them as a number |

### What Frustrates Them About Other FMOs

- Being treated as just a production number
- Getting templated, generic marketing materials
- Having to manage multiple FMO relationships for different product lines
- Slow case processing and commission payments
- Lack of real, hands-on support

## Secondary Audience: Prospective Advisors (Recruiting)

Advisors who are currently with another FMO or unaffiliated and considering a move.

- Same profile as above, but may be earlier in evaluating CreativeOne
- Motivated by: dissatisfaction with current FMO support, desire for better marketing, seeking a more comprehensive partner
- Sensitive to: overpromising, high-pressure sales tactics, vague value claims

## Audience Segments by Division

| Division | Audience Specifics |
|---|---|
| **Annuities** | The largest segment. Advisors whose primary business is annuity distribution. |
| **Life** | Life Insurance agents focused on selling Life policies. May also cross into Annuities. |
| **Medicare** | Advisors focused on Medicare solutions. |
| **Wealth** | Licensed RIAs and IARs. Served through CreativeOne Wealth (Corporate RIA). Open architecture, custodian agnostic. May have more complex compliance and regulatory considerations. |
| **Securities** | Registered representatives. Served through CreativeOne Securities (Broker-Dealer, FINRA/SIPC). Higher regulatory scrutiny. |

## Communication Preferences

- These are busy professionals — they value brevity and clarity over length
- They respond to specifics, not generalities ("we fill your seminar rooms" beats "we help you grow")
- They've heard every FMO pitch — credibility comes from specifics and proof, not claims
- They prefer a peer-to-peer tone, not a sales-to-prospect tone
