## Scope

These rules apply to **content created for or on behalf of licensed advisors and agents**, specifically:
- Content written **as the advisor** to their clients and prospects (advisor-to-consumer)
- Marketing materials, emails, and communications produced **for advisors** to use with their audience
- Any content that falls under the regulatory oversight of the Wealth, Securities, or Insurance industries

These rules do **not** apply to:
- **CreativeOne corporate marketing and advertising** (our own brand marketing to recruit or communicate with advisors/agents — this is business-to-business marketing and is not subject to the same regulatory requirements)
- Internal team communications
- SOPs and process documentation
- Internal project management content

> **Key distinction:** When we market CreativeOne as a company (recruiting advisors, promoting our services, event marketing), that is standard B2B marketing. When we create content that an advisor will use with their clients or prospects, that content must be compliant because it falls under financial/insurance industry regulations.

## Hard Rules — Never Violate

### 1. No Promissory or Absolute Language

Never use language that promises, guarantees, or implies certainty of outcomes.

**Prohibited words and phrases:**
| Category | Prohibited Terms |
|---|---|
| Guarantees | guarantee, guaranteed, ensure, assure, promise, certain, certainty |
| Absolutes | always, never, every time, without fail, no risk, risk-free, foolproof |
| Security claims | secure, secured, safe, protected (when referring to financial outcomes) |
| Free claims | free (when it implies no cost, obligation, or risk — context-dependent) |
| Outcome claims | will achieve, will grow, will increase, will protect, will outperform |

> **Note:** Some of these words are acceptable in non-financial contexts (e.g., "secure login" for a technology feature). The prohibition applies when these words relate to financial outcomes, investment performance, or business results.

### 2. No Definitive Outcome Claims

Never imply specific financial results, returns, guaranteed success, or predictable performance.

- ❌ "Our clients see an average 20% increase in AUM."
- ❌ "You'll double your book of business."
- ❌ "This strategy outperforms the market."

### 3. No Comparative Superiority Claims (Without Substantiation)

Avoid claiming to be "the best," "#1," or "the leading" without verifiable, compliant substantiation.

- ❌ "The best FMO in the industry."
- ✅ "One of the most experienced FMOs in the industry."

## Required Language Patterns

### Always Use Conditional, Qualified Language

Replace definitive claims with hedged, qualified phrasing.

**Hedging words to use:**
- help, aim to, designed to, may, can, could
- seek to, work toward, strive to, intended to
- potential, opportunity, possibilities
- support, assist, guide, position

### Compliant Rewrite Patterns

| Non-Compliant | Compliant |
|---|---|
| "We build our clients' financial portfolios to new heights." | "We help to build our clients' financial portfolios to new heights." |
| "Our strategies ensure long-term financial security." | "Our strategies are designed to help support long-term financial goals." |
| "You'll receive guaranteed returns on your investment." | "Your investment may offer the potential for competitive returns." |
| "We protect your clients' assets." | "We work to help protect your clients' assets." |
| "Our platform grows your business." | "Our platform is designed to help grow your business." |
| "Advisors who join us succeed." | "Advisors who join us may be well-positioned for growth." |
| "This will increase your revenue." | "This can help support revenue growth." |
| "We deliver superior results." | "We strive to deliver strong results for our partners." |

## Compliance Review Checklist

Before finalizing any **advisor-produced or advisor-facing content that falls under regulatory scope** (see Scope above), run through every sentence:

1. **Promissory language check:** Does any sentence promise a specific outcome? → Rewrite with qualified language.
2. **Prohibited word scan:** Does any sentence use words from the prohibited list? → Replace.
3. **Compliance officer test:** Could a compliance officer read this and flag it? → Soften.
4. **Reasonable person test:** Would a reasonable person interpret this as a guarantee? → Rewrite.
5. **Comparative claim check:** Does any sentence claim superiority without substantiation? → Qualify or remove.
6. **Testimonial/endorsement check:** If quoting or referencing a client's experience, is it framed as individual experience, not a guaranteed outcome? → Add appropriate disclaimers.

## Context-Specific Guidance

### Event Marketing
- **CreativeOne-hosted events** (incentive trips, recruiting events, appreciation events for advisors) are corporate B2B marketing and are **not subject to these compliance rules.**
- **Advisor-hosted client events** (seminars, dinner events, educational workshops for consumers) **are subject to these rules** because the audience is consumers in a financial/insurance context.
- ❌ "Attend this seminar and learn how to secure your retirement."
- ✅ "Join us for a seminar designed to help you explore strategies for your retirement goals."

### Recruiting / Advisor Prospecting
- **Note:** Recruiting content is CreativeOne corporate marketing (B2B) and is **not subject to these compliance rules.** Standard brand voice and marketing best practices apply instead. See `brands/creativeone/` for guidance.

### Advisor-Produced Content for Lead Generation
- Content advisors use to attract prospects must be compliant.
- ❌ "I'll grow your retirement fund by 10% annually."
- ✅ "I work with clients to help build strategies designed to pursue their retirement goals."

### Advisor Communications to Existing Clients
- Extra caution required. Consumer-facing financial content has the highest compliance scrutiny.
- All consumer-facing content should be reviewed as if a regulator will read it.
- Avoid any language that could be interpreted as investment advice, projected returns, or guaranteed outcomes.

## Disclaimers & Disclosures

When required by the content type, include appropriate disclaimers. Common scenarios:

- **Investment-related content:** May need disclosure that past performance is not indicative of future results.
- **Insurance product content:** May need state-specific licensing disclosures.
- **Testimonial or case study content:** Should note that individual results may vary.

> **When in doubt:** Flag the content for review by the in-house compliance department before publishing. It is always better to over-qualify than to produce non-compliant content.
