### 2026-02-26 — Microsoft Teams is the team communication platform
- **Context:** Confirmed during SOP build session.
- **Preference:** Always use Microsoft Teams (never Slack) for any reference to team messaging, notifications, channel pinning, or stakeholder communication. All team members have access — no need to caveat access requirements for Teams.

### 2026-02-26 — Asana tasks are the record of completion for recurring ops SOPs
- **Context:** Confirmed during SOP build session.
- **Preference:** When a recurring operational SOP has a completion/handoff step, the primary record should be a comment on the Asana task. A Teams notification to the relevant manager follows as a secondary ping. Do not treat a Teams message alone as sufficient documentation of completion.
