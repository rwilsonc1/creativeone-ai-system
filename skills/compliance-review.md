## Scope: When Compliance Review Applies

### Applies (Full Review Required)
- Any content written **as an advisor** to their clients, prospects, or the general public
- Advisor email nurture sequences, seminar invitations, social media posts, market updates, lead generation content, website copy, brochures
- Content that references or promotes financial products: annuities, life insurance, investment advisory services, securities
- Testimonials, endorsements, or third-party ratings used in advisor marketing
- Performance data or returns referenced in any advisor-facing marketing

### Does NOT Apply
- CreativeOne corporate B2B marketing (recruiting, event invitations to advisors, service announcements, internal communications)
- Internal SOPs, process documents, team communications
- Content that does not reference financial products or advisory services

### Gray Areas — When in Doubt, Review
- Event marketing for advisor client events (applies — the advisor's clients are the audience)
- Co-branded content where CreativeOne and an advisor are both represented (applies — consumer-facing)
- Educational content that doesn't promote a specific product but is distributed by an advisor (applies — still advisor-voiced, still reaches consumers)

## The Regulatory Framework

Claude is **not a compliance officer, not a lawyer, and not a registered principal.** Claude's compliance review is a **pre-screening layer** that catches obvious issues before content reaches the actual compliance team. Claude should flag potential issues and recommend changes but always defer to the in-house compliance department for final approval.

Understanding the regulatory landscape helps Claude flag the right issues in the right context.

### Insurance & Annuities — State Regulation via NAIC Models

**Governing framework:** NAIC Model Laws (MDL-570 for Life/Annuities, MDL-880 Unfair Trade Practices Act), adopted with variations by individual states.

**Core principles:**
- Advertisements must be **truthful and not misleading in fact or by implication**
- Content must be understandable by an audience of **average education or intelligence** — no jargon without explanation
- Insurers are responsible for **all advertising that mentions their products**, including content created by agents/producers
- **Unfair comparisons** of competitors are prohibited
- The words **"free," "no cost,"** or similar import cannot be used to describe insurance coverage (can be used for quotes or informational downloads)
- Cannot imply licensing beyond jurisdictions where the insurer is actually licensed
- Cannot use titles like "financial planner" or "investment adviser" unless actually engaged in that capacity

**Prohibited/restricted language (insurance-specific):**

| Prohibited | Why | Compliant Alternative |
|---|---|---|
| "Guaranteed" (when referring to policy outcomes beyond contractual guarantees) | Promissory; only contractual guarantees backed by insurer financial strength are permissible | "Contractually guaranteed by [Insurer] subject to the financial strength of the issuing company" |
| "Free," "no cost" (describing insurance coverage) | Explicitly prohibited by NAIC UTPA | "Included in your policy" or "at no additional premium" |
| "Investment," "profit," "savings" (for non-securities insurance) | MDL-570 prohibits these for life insurance products that are not securities | "Cash value accumulation," "potential growth," "death benefit protection" |
| "Founder's plan" | Explicitly prohibited by MDL-570 | Remove entirely |
| Unfair comparisons to competitors | Prohibited — cannot disparage or make misleading comparisons | Compare features factually with full context, or avoid comparisons |
| "Risk-free" | No insurance product is risk-free | "Designed to help protect" or "may help reduce exposure to" |

**Key distinction:** Insurance contractual guarantees (death benefit, minimum interest rate, income rider payments) **can** be stated as guarantees — but must always be qualified with "subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing company."

### Wealth / RIA — SEC Marketing Rule (Rule 206(4)-1)

**Governing framework:** SEC Investment Advisers Act of 1940, amended Marketing Rule (effective November 2022). Applies to all SEC-registered investment advisers (RIAs) and investment adviser representatives (IARs).

**Core principles — Seven General Prohibitions:**
An advertisement may not:
1. Include an **untrue statement of material fact** or omit a material fact that makes it misleading
2. Include a **material claim that is unsubstantiated** — the adviser must have a reasonable basis to believe the claim is true
3. Include an **untrue or misleading implication** about the adviser or its services
4. Discuss **potential benefits without fair and balanced treatment of associated risks or limitations**
5. Reference **specific investment advice that is not fair and balanced**
6. Include or exclude **performance results in a way that is misleading**
7. Be otherwise **materially misleading**

**Testimonials & endorsements (SEC hot-button issue as of 2025):**
- Now permitted (previously prohibited), but with strict conditions
- **Required disclosures (must be "clear and prominent"):** whether the person is a current client, whether they were compensated, material conflicts of interest
- If compensated: specific amount of cash compensation (or percentage + time period) must be disclosed
- Written agreement required with paid promoters
- Adviser must have "reasonable basis for belief" that testimonial/endorsement complies
- Hyperlinked disclosures or small-font disclosures are **not sufficient** — disclosures must be proximate, visible, and prominent

**Performance advertising:**
- Gross performance **must** be accompanied by net performance
- Hypothetical performance can only be shown to audiences for whom it would be relevant (not the general public / mass audience)
- Past performance disclaimers required: "Past performance is not indicative of future results"
- Cannot cherry-pick time periods that paint a misleading picture

**What this means for content creation:**
- Every benefit claim must be balanced with risks/limitations
- No unsubstantiated superlatives ("best," "top," "leading" without verifiable basis)
- Client success stories require full disclosure framework
- Performance data requires net figures, time periods, and disclaimers
- AI claims must be accurate and substantiable (SEC enforced against false AI marketing claims in 2024)

---

### Securities — FINRA Rule 2210

**Governing framework:** FINRA Rule 2210 (Communications with the Public). Applies to all FINRA-registered broker-dealers, including CreativeOne Securities.

**Communication categories:**
- **Retail communications** (distributed to 25+ retail investors in 30 days): Require **pre-approval by a registered principal** before first use. Certain types must be filed with FINRA.
- **Correspondence** (written communication to 25 or fewer retail investors in 30 days): Must be supervised, may be reviewed after use.
- **Institutional communications** (to institutional investors only): Must have supervisory procedures, but lighter review.

**Core content standards (all communication types):**
- Must be **fair and balanced** — cannot emphasize benefits without disclosing risks
- Must provide **sound basis for evaluating facts** about any security, industry, or service
- Cannot **omit material facts** that would make the communication misleading
- Cannot **predict or project performance** or imply that past performance guarantees future results
- **Comparisons** between investments must be complete — including costs, guarantees, liquidity, tax features, and safety
- Cannot contain **exaggerated, unwarranted, or misleading** statements or claims

**Prohibited language (securities-specific):**

| Prohibited | Why | Compliant Alternative |
|---|---|---|
| "Guaranteed returns" | FINRA 2210(d) prohibits promissory statements about securities | "Historically, this strategy has sought to..." |
| Implying certainty of outcomes | No securities outcome is certain | "Designed to pursue," "aims to," "seeks to" |
| Cherry-picked performance | Must show representative time periods | Show standard periods (1yr, 5yr, 10yr, since inception) |
| Omitting risks when stating benefits | Fair and balanced requirement | Always pair benefit statements with relevant risks |
| "Safe investment" for any security | All securities carry risk | "May help provide stability" + risk disclosure |
| Unsubstantiated superlatives ("best," "top") | Must have verifiable factual basis | Remove or substantiate with verifiable source |

**Filing & recordkeeping:**
- Retail communications about mutual funds, variable insurance products, and public direct participation programs must be filed with FINRA within 10 business days of first use
- New FINRA member firms must file initial advertisements 10 business days **prior** to use
- All business communications must be archived (including drafts and approval records)
- Off-channel communications (personal email, text, social media DMs) are a major enforcement area

## The Compliance Review Process

### Step 1: Determine Regulatory Context

Before reviewing content, identify which regulatory framework(s) apply:

| Content Type | Primary Regulation | Additional Considerations |
|---|---|---|
| Annuity marketing | NAIC MDL-570 + state insurance laws | Variable annuities also fall under FINRA 2210 |
| Life insurance marketing | NAIC MDL-570 + state insurance laws | Variable life also falls under FINRA 2210 |
| Investment advisory services | SEC Marketing Rule | — |
| Securities products (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) | FINRA Rule 2210 | SEC rules also apply |
| Variable products (variable annuities, variable life) | **Both** FINRA 2210 AND state insurance laws | Dual-regulated — highest scrutiny |
| Wealth management / financial planning | SEC Marketing Rule | If broker-dealer involved, also FINRA |

> ⚠️ **Variable products are dual-regulated.** Content about variable annuities or variable life insurance must comply with BOTH FINRA 2210 and state insurance advertising regulations. Apply the stricter standard.

### Step 2: Run the Universal Compliance Scan

These checks apply to **all** advisor-voiced content, regardless of vertical:

**2a. Prohibited Language Scan**

Scan for terms from the prohibited list in `context/compliance-guidelines.md` AND the vertical-specific prohibited terms above. Flag every instance.

**2b. Promissory Language Check**

Flag any sentence that:
- Promises a specific outcome ("you will," "this ensures," "guarantees that")
- States an absolute ("always," "never," "every time," "without exception")
- Implies certainty about the future ("this will protect your retirement," "your income is secure")

**Rewrite pattern:** Replace absolute language with conditional/qualified language.
- ❌ "This annuity will protect your principal."
- ✅ "This annuity is designed to help protect your principal, subject to the terms of the contract and the financial strength of the issuing company."

**2c. Fair and Balanced Check**

For every **benefit** stated, verify there is a corresponding **risk, limitation, or qualification** either in the same sentence, the same paragraph, or an accompanying disclosure. This is the single most common compliance failure across all three verticals.

- ❌ "Our investment strategy has consistently outperformed the market."
- ✅ "Our investment strategy has sought to outperform the market over time, though past performance is not indicative of future results and all investments carry the risk of loss."

**2d. Substantiation Check**

Flag any claim that requires factual support:
- Statistics, rankings, awards, or numerical claims → Must have a verifiable source
- Superlatives ("best," "top," "leading," "#1") → Must be substantiated or removed
- AI or technology claims → Must be accurate and current (SEC enforcement area)
- Client success stories → Must be documentable and disclosed

**2e. Readability Check**

Content must be understandable to an audience of average education. Flag:
- Financial jargon used without explanation
- Complex sentence structures that obscure meaning
- Acronyms used without definition on first use
- Legal language that a consumer wouldn't understand

### Step 3: Run Vertical-Specific Checks

Load the applicable vertical file from `brands/advisor/verticals/` and run additional checks:

**Insurance/Annuities:**
- [ ] No use of "free," "no cost," "investment," "profit," "savings" (for non-securities products)
- [ ] Contractual guarantees qualified with issuing company financial strength language
- [ ] No unfair comparisons to competitors
- [ ] No implied licensing beyond actual jurisdictions
- [ ] Ratings (if referenced) include: rating agency name, rating, relative ranking in scale, date

**Wealth/RIA:**
- [ ] Every benefit paired with risks/limitations (SEC General Prohibition #4)
- [ ] No unsubstantiated material claims (SEC General Prohibition #2)
- [ ] Testimonials include all required disclosures: client status, compensation, conflicts
- [ ] Testimonial disclosures are "clear and prominent" — not buried, hyperlinked, or small-font
- [ ] Performance data includes net alongside gross, standard time periods, past performance disclaimer
- [ ] No hypothetical performance shown to mass/general audience

**Securities:**
- [ ] All FINRA "fair and balanced" requirements met
- [ ] No predictions or projections of performance
- [ ] Investment comparisons include costs, guarantees, liquidity, tax features, safety
- [ ] No exaggerated or unwarranted claims
- [ ] Content flagged for principal pre-approval if retail communication
- [ ] Filing requirements noted if applicable (mutual funds, variable products, DPPs)

### Step 4: Check Required Disclosures

Based on the content type and vertical, verify that all required disclosures are present:

**Universal disclosures (always include when applicable):**
- "FOR FINANCIAL PROFESSIONAL USE ONLY" (if advisor-facing, not consumer-facing)
- Entity disclosures (CreativeOne Securities: registered broker-dealer, member FINRA/SIPC; CreativeOne Wealth: SEC-registered RIA)

**Product-specific disclosures:**
- Insurance/annuities: "Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company"
- Securities: "Securities offered through CreativeOne Securities, Inc., member FINRA/SIPC"
- Investment advisory: "Investment advisory services offered through CreativeOne Wealth, an SEC-registered investment adviser"
- Performance: "Past performance is not indicative of future results. All investments involve risk, including potential loss of principal."

**Testimonial/endorsement disclosures (when applicable):**
- Whether the person is a current client/investor
- Whether they received compensation (and the specific terms)
- Any material conflicts of interest
- Must be clear, prominent, and proximate to the testimonial

### Step 5: Document the Review

For audit trail and compliance department handoff:

1. **Identify all flagged items** with specific line/section references
2. **Categorize severity:**
   - 🔴 **Must fix** — content cannot be used as-is (prohibited language, missing required disclosures, promissory statements, unsubstantiated claims)
   - 🟡 **Recommend fix** — not a hard violation but could be interpreted as misleading or non-compliant by a strict reviewer
   - 🟢 **Suggestion** — improvements for clarity or tone that would strengthen compliance posture
3. **Provide compliant rewrites** for every flagged item
4. **Note which regulatory framework(s)** informed each flag (FINRA 2210, SEC Marketing Rule, NAIC MDL-570, state insurance law)
5. **Recommend the content be submitted to the in-house compliance department for final review.** Claude's review is a pre-screen, not a replacement for compliance sign-off.

## Common Compliance Failure Patterns

These are the most frequent issues across all three verticals, based on regulatory enforcement patterns:

| Pattern | Verticals | What to Watch For |
|---|---|---|
| **Benefits without risks** | All | Any sentence that touts a benefit without a corresponding limitation. The most common failure in every vertical. |
| **Promissory language** | All | "Guarantee," "ensure," "secure," "protect" used as absolutes without qualifiers. |
| **Unsubstantiated claims** | Wealth, Securities | Awards, rankings, "best" claims without verifiable source. SEC fined multiple RIAs for this in 2024. |
| **Testimonial disclosure failures** | Wealth | Missing or buried disclosures. SEC's December 2025 Risk Alert flagged this as the #1 observed deficiency. |
| **Hypothetical performance to mass audience** | Wealth, Securities | SEC charged 14+ advisers in 2023-2024 for showing hypothetical performance on public websites. |
| **"Free" in insurance context** | Insurance | Explicitly prohibited by NAIC UTPA for describing insurance coverage. |
| **Missing issuing company financial strength qualifier** | Insurance, Annuities | Contractual guarantees stated without "subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing company." |
| **Off-channel communications** | Securities | Major SEC/FINRA enforcement area (2023-2025). Not a content issue, but worth flagging if the content is intended for informal channels. |

## Critical Reminders

1. **Claude is not a compliance officer.** This skill provides pre-screening to catch obvious issues and improve the quality of content before it reaches compliance. It does not replace human compliance review.
2. **When in doubt, flag it.** It is always better to over-flag than to miss a compliance issue. False positives are inconvenient; false negatives are potentially actionable.
3. **The compliance department has final authority.** If the in-house compliance team approves content that Claude flagged, the compliance team's decision stands.
4. **Regulations evolve.** The SEC, FINRA, and state insurance departments update rules and enforcement priorities regularly. This skill should be updated when new guidance is issued. The SEC Marketing Rule enforcement landscape is particularly active (2023-2026).
5. **Variable products require dual review.** Variable annuities and variable life insurance fall under both securities regulations (FINRA/SEC) and insurance regulations (NAIC/state). Always apply the stricter standard.
