# Skill: Compliance-Friendly Advisor Marketing

> **Trigger:** Writing new advisor-voiced marketing content — emails, landing pages, nurture sequences, social posts, seminar invitations.
> **Applies to:** All content written as/for advisors to their clients or prospects.
> **Context required:** Load `context/compliance-guidelines.md` + applicable vertical file from `brands/advisor/verticals/`.
> **Companion skill:** For *reviewing* existing content, use `skills/compliance-review.md` instead.
> **Default rule:** When licensing is unclear, default to the most conservative compliance interpretation (insurance-only).

## Purpose

This skill guides the creation of persuasive, trust-building marketing copy for financial advisors that adheres to compliance standards from the start. Prevention is more efficient than correction — building compliance in during writing avoids revision cycles with the compliance team.

## Core Writing Principles

### 1. No Promissory Language

Never use:
- guarantee / guaranteed
- safe / secure (when used as certainty)
- will (implying outcome certainty)
- best
- always
- no risk / risk-free
- maximize / optimize
- protect (when used as certainty)
- grow (when used as certainty)
- eliminate risk

Replace with:
- may help
- designed to
- intended to
- can support
- explore ways to
- structured to
- help evaluate
- could reduce
- can provide insight
- may influence

---

### 2. Balance Every Benefit

Every benefit must include or imply a limitation. Never present a benefit without context, conditions, or variability.

❌ "Reduce your taxes in retirement."
✅ "Explore strategies that may help reduce unnecessary tax exposure, depending on your situation."

❌ "Protect your retirement savings."
✅ "Review strategies designed to help manage risk within your retirement portfolio."

---

### 3. No Predictions or Future Outcomes

Do not imply:
- Market direction
- Guaranteed income
- Investment growth
- Tax certainty
- Retirement success outcomes

**Required language when applicable:**

> **Performance Disclaimer:** Past performance does not guarantee future results. All investments involve risk, including potential loss of principal.

> **Tax Disclaimer:** Tax laws are subject to change; consult a qualified tax professional.

---

### 4. Insurance Default Rule

If licensing is unknown, default to insurance-only language.

**Required annuity disclosure:**
> Annuities are long-term products that may include fees and surrender charges. Product features vary by carrier and state. Guarantees are backed by the issuing insurer's claims-paying ability.

Never describe annuities as:
- Market-proof
- Risk-free
- Guaranteed growth
- Completely protected

---

### 5. Testimonials — Use With Care

Testimonials are permitted under the SEC Marketing Rule (2022) for RIA-registered advisors, but only with strict compliance disclosure requirements. For advisors whose licensing status is unknown, **default to avoiding testimonials entirely.**

**When testimonials may be used** (RIA/IAR only, with advisor's compliance team confirmation):
- Must disclose whether the person is a current client
- Must disclose whether they were compensated (and the specific terms if so)
- Must disclose any material conflicts of interest
- Disclosures must be clear, prominent, and proximate — not buried, hyperlinked, or in small font

> ⚠️ **If an advisor requests testimonial copy:** Flag that this requires compliance team review and full SEC Marketing Rule disclosure compliance before use. Do not produce finalized testimonial copy without that confirmation.

**Default approach — use compliant alternatives instead:**
- Hypothetical scenarios: "Some individuals approaching retirement may..."
- General observations: "Many individuals find that..."
- Process-based credibility: Highlight the advisor's methodology, not client outcomes

❌ "Jack retired early thanks to our strategy."
✅ "Some individuals approaching retirement may explore structured income planning to evaluate whether earlier retirement is feasible based on their circumstances."

### 6. Avoid the Word "Educational"

Avoid: *educational*

Replace with:
- informational
- guidance
- insights
- overview
- review
- walkthrough
- discussion

---

## Structural Frameworks

### Landing Page Structure

**Headline** — Risk-aware and curiosity-driven. Avoid hype or urgency.

Examples:
- "See Which Retirement Risks May Affect Your Plan"
- "Is Your Retirement Strategy Aligned With Today's Tax Environment?"
- "A Complimentary Retirement Risk Review"

**Subheadline** — Benefit plus qualifier.
> "Receive a complimentary review designed to help you evaluate potential gaps and risks."

**Bullet Points** — Use soft verbs:
- Evaluate
- Review
- Explore
- Identify
- Understand
- Clarify
- Assess

Each bullet must avoid certainty or outcome guarantees.

**CTA Language**

Approved:
- Request Your Complimentary Review
- Start Your Risk Checkup
- Schedule a 15-Minute Introductory Call
- Explore Your Options

Avoid:
- Act now / Don't wait / Limited spots / Claim before it's gone / Urgent

---

### Email Nurture Framework (6-Email Sequence)

**Email 1 — Welcome + Credibility**
Purpose: Establish trust and outline the process.
- Include: Professional credentials, overview of what to expect, clear next steps, soft invitation
- Avoid: Outcome claims, transformational promises

**Email 2 — Problem Awareness**
Focus: Common financial concerns, complexity, questions prospects may have
- Avoid: Fear-based language, urgent pressure

**Email 3 — Process Credibility (Instead of Testimonials)**
Highlight: Planning process, review methodology, fiduciary or fee structure (if applicable)
- Avoid: Story-based persuasion, implied performance success

**Email 4 — Objection Handling**
Address: Cost, complexity, self-management, trust
- Use neutral language: "You may be wondering..." / "Some individuals prefer..."
- Never imply superiority over competitors

**Email 5 — Perspective Shift**
Reframe retirement planning carefully.
> "Retirement planning often involves more than investments. It may also include tax considerations, income structuring, and risk alignment."
- Avoid criticizing other advisors

**Email 6 — Calm Invitation**
Low-pressure close.
> "If it would be helpful, you may schedule a brief introductory call to determine whether a deeper conversation makes sense."
- Avoid emotional urgency
