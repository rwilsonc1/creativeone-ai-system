## Pre-Flight Checklist

Before writing any email, resolve these questions:

1. **Who is sending this?**
   - CreativeOne → Load `brands/creativeone/` files per the context loading matrix
   - An advisor → Load `brands/advisor/voice-foundation.md` + vertical + individual (if exists)

2. **Who is receiving this?**
   - Advisors/agents (CreativeOne B2B) → No compliance constraints, use CreativeOne brand voice
   - Consumers/clients (advisor-voiced) → Full compliance rules from `context/compliance-guidelines.md`

3. **What is the email type?** (See Email Types below)

4. **What is the goal?** Define the single primary action you want the reader to take.

5. **Check `memory/corrections.md` and `memory/preferences.md`** for any email-specific learnings.

## Email Types & Frameworks

### Event Invitation

**Use for:** Incentive trips, appreciation events, educational events, recruiting events, seminars, webinars.

**Structure:**
| Section | Purpose | Guidelines |
|---|---|---|
| **Subject line** | Get the open | Specific, benefit-oriented, concise. Include event name or value hook. Avoid all caps, excessive punctuation, spam trigger words. |
| **Preview text** | Support the subject line | Expand on the subject — don't repeat it. 40–90 characters. |
| **Opening (1–2 sentences)** | Hook + context | Lead with what's in it for them or a warm greeting. Set the scene. |
| **Event details block** | Who, what, when, where | Clear, scannable. Use bold for key details (date, location, time). |
| **Value proposition (2–3 sentences)** | Why attend | What they'll gain: knowledge, connections, recognition, relaxation. Be specific. |
| **CTA** | Drive registration/response | One clear, prominent button. Action-oriented text ("Reserve Your Spot", "Register Now"). |
| **Closing (1–2 sentences)** | Warm sign-off | Reinforce excitement or value. Keep it brief. |

**Subject line formulas:**
- `[Event Name]: [Date] in [Location]`
- `You're Invited: [Event Name] — [Value Hook]`
- `Join Us for [Event Name] — [Specific Benefit]`
- `[Date]: [Event Name] in [Location] — [Short Value Hook]`

### Product/Service Announcement

**Use for:** New product launches, service updates, program rollouts, partnership announcements.

**Structure:**
| Section | Purpose | Guidelines |
|---|---|---|
| **Subject line** | Get the open | Lead with the news or the benefit. Be specific about what's new. |
| **Preview text** | Support the subject line | Add a detail not in the subject. |
| **Opening (1–2 sentences)** | State the news | Clear, direct. What's new and why it matters to the reader. |
| **Body (3–5 sentences)** | Explain the value | What does this mean for the reader? What problem does it solve? How does it work? Be specific, not vague. |
| **CTA** | Drive next step | One primary action: learn more, sign up, schedule a call, etc. |
| **Closing (1 sentence)** | Sign-off | Brief. |

---

### Nurture Sequence Email

**Use for:** Ongoing relationship-building with prospects or clients. Multi-touch drip sequences.

**Structure:**
| Section | Purpose | Guidelines |
|---|---|---|
| **Subject line** | Get the open | Educational angle works best. Pique curiosity or reference a pain point. |
| **Preview text** | Support the subject line | Tease the value inside. |
| **Opening (1–2 sentences)** | Connect to a pain point or interest | Empathize with a situation or ask a question the reader is thinking about. |
| **Body (3–6 sentences)** | Deliver value | Teach something, share an insight, provide a framework. The reader should feel smarter after reading this. |
| **CTA** | Soft next step | Not always a hard sell. Can be: "Reply if you'd like to talk about this," "Read the full guide," "Here's a quick checklist." |
| **Closing (1 sentence)** | Warm, personal | Feels like it's from a real person, not a brand. |

**Nurture sequence principles:**
- Each email should stand alone (reader may not have read the previous ones)
- Value first, pitch later — early emails should be 90% educational
- Progression: Awareness → Education → Consideration → Conversation
- Vary the format: tips, stories, questions, checklists, short insights
- Frequency: Don't over-send. Quality over volume.

### Market Update / Timely Communication

**Use for:** Market volatility updates, regulatory changes, timely financial news. Typically advisor-voiced.

**Structure:**
| Section | Purpose | Guidelines |
|---|---|---|
| **Subject line** | Signal relevance and timeliness | Reference the event or topic. Calm tone, not alarmist. |
| **Preview text** | Set expectations | "Here's what this means for you" framing. |
| **Opening (1–2 sentences)** | Acknowledge the situation | Name what happened. Be factual and calm. |
| **Body (3–5 sentences)** | Explain the context | What does this mean? How should the reader think about it? What is the advisor doing or monitoring? |
| **Reassurance (1–2 sentences)** | Calm and guide | Reinforce that the reader's plan accounts for situations like this. Offer to talk. |
| **CTA** | Offer availability | "If you'd like to discuss how this affects your plan, I'm here." Low-pressure. |

**Tone note:** These emails should feel like a calm, knowledgeable friend calling to say "I'm watching this, here's what I think, and you're okay." Never alarmist, never dismissive.

### Recruiting Outreach

**Use for:** Prospecting new advisors/agents to join CreativeOne. Always CreativeOne voice.

**Structure:**
| Section | Purpose | Guidelines |
|---|---|---|
| **Subject line** | Get the open | Benefit-focused or curiosity-driven. Not salesy. |
| **Preview text** | Expand the hook | |
| **Opening (1–2 sentences)** | Relevance + respect | Acknowledge who they are and what they've built. Don't open with us — open with them. |
| **Body (3–5 sentences)** | Value proposition | What does CreativeOne offer that's different? Be specific — marketing agency, seminar program, back-office support, etc. Reference the messaging pillars from `brands/creativeone/positioning.md`. |
| **Social proof (1–2 sentences)** | Credibility | 40+ years, thousands of advisors, specific stats from `brands/creativeone/assets.md`. |
| **CTA** | Low-friction next step | "Book a strategy session," "Let's have a quick conversation," etc. Not "Sign up now." |
| **Closing (1 sentence)** | Warm, professional | |

---

### Post-Event Follow-Up

**Use for:** After events, seminars, webinars, or meetings.

**Structure:**
| Section | Purpose | Guidelines |
|---|---|---|
| **Subject line** | Reference the event | "Great seeing you at [Event]" or "Following up from [Event]" |
| **Preview text** | Tease next step or value | |
| **Opening (1–2 sentences)** | Thank + reference shared experience | Warm, specific. Reference something from the event if possible. |
| **Body (2–4 sentences)** | Deliver promised value or next step | If something was promised (a resource, a follow-up call), deliver it. If not, provide value related to the event topic. |
| **CTA** | Clear next step | Schedule a call, download a resource, register for the next event. |
| **Closing (1 sentence)** | Warm | |

## Writing Rules — All Email Types

### Subject Lines
- **Length:** 6–10 words / 30–50 characters ideal. Under 60 characters to avoid mobile truncation.
- **Personalization:** Use `[First Name]` when available and appropriate. Don't force it.
- **Avoid:** ALL CAPS, excessive punctuation (!!!), spam trigger words ("free", "act now", "limited time"), clickbait without payoff.
- **Test:** Would you open this if you saw it in your inbox at 7am?

### Preview Text
- 40–90 characters
- Complements the subject line — doesn't repeat it
- Provides additional context or teases the email content
- If not set intentionally, email clients will pull the first line of body copy — always set it deliberately

### Body Copy
- **Scannable:** Short paragraphs (2–3 sentences max). Use line breaks generously.
- **Conversational:** Write like you're talking to one person, not broadcasting to a list.
- **Specific:** Replace vague claims with concrete details. "Our seminar program" < "Pre-approved seminar presentations with paid advertising to fill the room."
- **Front-loaded:** Lead every paragraph with the most important information.
- **Length:** Respect the reader's time. Most marketing emails should be 100–200 words. Nurture emails can go longer if the content warrants it.

### CTAs
- **One primary CTA per email.** Secondary CTAs are okay but should be visually subordinate.
- **Button text should be action-oriented:** "Register Now," "Book a Strategy Session," "Download the Guide" — not "Click Here" or "Learn More" (though "Learn More" is acceptable as a secondary CTA).
- **Placement:** Primary CTA should appear after the value proposition, not before. Don't ask for action before giving a reason.

### Tone Matching
- Match the tone to the brand context loaded. CreativeOne B2B emails can be more direct and energetic. Advisor-voiced emails should be warmer and more educational.
- When in doubt, re-read the voice profile for the active brand.

## Compliance Check (Advisor-Voiced Emails Only)

Before finalizing any advisor-voiced email, run through:

1. **Promissory language scan:** Any sentence that promises a specific outcome? → Rewrite.
2. **Prohibited word check:** Any words from the prohibited list in `context/compliance-guidelines.md`? → Replace.
3. **Reasonable person test:** Would a reader interpret any statement as a guarantee? → Soften.
4. **Disclosure check:** Does this email need a disclaimer? (Investment content, securities, insurance products) → Add.
5. **Vertical-specific rules:** Check the loaded vertical file for additional compliance framing.

> Compliance does NOT apply to CreativeOne B2B emails (recruiting, event invitations to advisors, service announcements).

## HubSpot-Specific Notes

- **Personalization tokens:** Use `{{ contact.firstname }}` for first name. Always set a default value (e.g., "there" or "friend") in case the property is empty.
- **A/B testing:** When volume allows, A/B test subject lines. Test one variable at a time.
- **Send time:** Consider the audience. Advisor B2B emails tend to perform well mid-morning (Tues–Thurs). Consumer emails vary.
- **Lists:** Confirm the correct list/segment before sending. Double-check suppression lists.
- **Preview and test:** Always send a test email and preview on mobile before scheduling.
