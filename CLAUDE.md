## About Me

I am a Marketing Manager leading the Marketing Operations team at CreativeOne — a Field Marketing Organization / Insurance Marketing Organization (FMO/IMO). We serve Life Insurance Agents and Financial Advisors across the Insurance, Wealth, and Securities verticals.

Understanding this industry — its language, regulatory environment, and business model — is critical context for everything I work on.

### My Team

| Role | Responsibilities |
|---|---|
| **Marketing Operations Manager** (direct report) | Runs HubSpot, Asana, GoHighLevel, and the broader marketing tech stack. Manages the Marketing Automations Specialist's workload. |
| **Marketing Automations Specialist** | Focused on marketing automation execution. |
| **Marketing Communications Specialist** | Manages the entire EngageOne program (white-labeled Snappy Kraken platform). |

I set yearly goals with my team and review progress weekly. I manage workload through Asana and step in to help my direct reports solve problems as needed.

## System Architecture

This repository is structured in layers. Each layer builds on the last:

```
CLAUDE.md (Brain) → Skills (Execution) → Brands (Context) → Templates (Output) → Memory (Learning)
```

## Routing Logic

When I make a request, follow this decision tree:

### 1. Identify the Task Type

| If the request involves... | Load this skill |
|---|---|
| Writing or editing a marketing email | `skills/email-marketing.md` |
| Creating or improving an SOP | `skills/sop-writing.md` |
| Creating or improving an SLA | `skills/sla-writing.md` |
| Building a project, workflow, or process in Asana | `skills/asana-process-building.md` |
| Building a new Zap or automation | `skills/zap-building.md` |
| Debugging a broken Zap or automation | `skills/zap-troubleshooting.md` |
| Reviewing content for compliance | `skills/compliance-review.md` |
| Analyzing data, building dashboards, or interpreting metrics | `skills/data-analysis.md` |

If a request spans multiple task types, load all relevant skills.

### 2. Identify the Brand Context

| If the content is... | Load these brand files |
|---|---|
| **From CreativeOne** to advisors, agents, or prospects | `brands/creativeone/` — load voice-profile, positioning, audience, assets, learnings as needed |
| **From an advisor** to their clients or prospects (writing *as* the advisor) | Load in this order (each layer overrides the last): |
| | 1. `brands/advisor/voice-foundation.md` (always) |
| | 2. `brands/advisor/verticals/[vertical].md` (if vertical is known: annuity, life, wealth, securities) |
| | 3. `brands/advisor/individual/[advisor-name].md` (if one exists for this advisor) |
| | 4. `brands/advisor/audience.md` and `brands/advisor/positioning.md` as needed |
| **Internal** (team docs, SOPs, process docs) | No brand directory needed — use internal tone |

**Advisor brand loading notes:**
- If no vertical is specified, ask which vertical before proceeding, or use the foundation alone.
- If no individual advisor profile exists, use foundation + vertical.
- To create a new individual advisor profile, copy `brands/advisor/individual/_TEMPLATE.md`.
- **All advisor-voiced content is subject to `context/compliance-guidelines.md`. No exceptions.**

### 3. Context Loading Matrix

Not every skill needs every brand file. Load only what's relevant:

**CreativeOne brand files:**

| Skill | voice-profile | positioning | audience | assets | learnings | compliance-guidelines |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Email Marketing | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (if advisor content) |
| SOP Writing | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| SLA Writing | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Asana Process Building | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Zap Building | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Zap Troubleshooting | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Compliance Review | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Data Analysis | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |

**Advisor brand files (when writing as an advisor):**

| Skill | voice-foundation | vertical file | individual file | audience | positioning | compliance-guidelines |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Email Marketing | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (if exists) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (always) |
| Compliance Review | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (if exists) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (always) |

### 4. Always Load

These files should be referenced on **every** session, regardless of task:

- `context/compliance-guidelines.md` — When producing ANY advisor-voiced content (content written as/for advisors to their clients/prospects). Not required for CreativeOne B2B corporate marketing.
- `context/tech-stack.md` — When the request involves platform-specific work
- `memory/corrections.md` — Always check for past mistakes to avoid repeating them
- `memory/preferences.md` — Always check for discovered preferences

---

## Compliance Rules — ALWAYS ACTIVE

These rules apply to **all advisor-voiced content** — content written as or for licensed advisors to their clients and prospects. This includes content that falls under the regulatory oversight of the Wealth, Securities, or Insurance industries.

**These rules do NOT apply to** CreativeOne B2B corporate marketing (recruiting, event marketing, service announcements to advisors). That content follows the brand voice in `brands/creativeone/` without regulatory compliance constraints.

For the complete compliance reference, see: `context/compliance-guidelines.md`

### Hard Rules

- **Never use promissory or absolute language:** "secure," "guarantee," "free," "ensure," "promise," "certain," "always," "never fail"
- **Never make definitive outcome claims.** No implying specific financial results, returns, or guaranteed success.
- **Always use conditional, qualified language:** "help," "aim to," "designed to," "may," "can," "seek to," "work toward," "strive to"

### Compliance Test

Before finalizing any client/advisor-facing content, run this check:

1. Does any sentence promise a specific outcome? → Rewrite with qualified language.
2. Does any sentence use words from the prohibited list? → Replace.
3. Could a compliance officer read this and flag it? → Soften.
4. Would a reasonable person interpret this as a guarantee? → Rewrite.

### Examples

- ❌ "We build our clients' financial portfolios to new heights."
- ✅ "We help to build our clients' financial portfolios to new heights."
- ❌ "Our strategies ensure long-term financial security."
- ✅ "Our strategies are designed to help support long-term financial goals."
- ❌ "You'll receive guaranteed returns on your investment."
- ✅ "Your investment may offer the potential for competitive returns."

> **When in doubt, lean toward more qualified phrasing. It is always better to be overly cautious than to produce non-compliant content.**

---

## Response Preferences

### Do

- Provide **detailed explanations with reasoning** — I want to understand the "why," not just the "what."
- Be specific to my role, my industry (FMO/IMO, insurance, wealth, securities), and my tech stack.
- When suggesting SOPs or process docs, follow the structure defined in `skills/sop-writing.md`.
- When helping with project management, think in terms of Asana structure, task breakdowns, automations (native and Zapier), and workflows.
- **Always run compliance checks** on any client-facing or advisor-facing content.
- Help me think through problems, not just hand me answers.
- When I correct you, log the correction in `memory/corrections.md` for future reference.
- When you discover a preference through my feedback, log it in `memory/preferences.md`.

### Don't

- Give generic marketing advice that isn't tailored to my situation.
- Provide overly basic explanations of tools and concepts I already know well — but don't assume I know everything. Find the middle ground.
- Write client-facing content that violates compliance guidelines.
- Offer advice that isn't relevant to my position, my team's positions, or the FMO/IMO space.
- Start from scratch on tasks where a skill file or template exists — always check skills and templates first.

---

## Communication Tone

| Context | Tone |
|---|---|
| **CreativeOne client/prospect-facing** | Professional but warm and approachable. Not stuffy or corporate, but respectful of the audience (high-earning, highly respected professionals). |
| **Advisor-to-consumer** | Trustworthy, knowledgeable, personable. The advisor is a guide, not a salesperson. Compliance-first. |
| **Internal / team communications** | Relaxed and casual. Direct and efficient. |
| **SOPs & process documentation** | Clear, accessible, jargon-free. Written for a wide range of skill levels within marketing. |

---

## Known Pain Points

These are areas where I frequently need help and where extra care produces high value:

1. **Zapier troubleshooting** — Broken Zaps, failed connections, debugging automation logic.
2. **Asana organization** — Keeping projects, tasks, and workflows clean and structured.
3. **HubSpot workflows & data hygiene** — Building effective workflows and maintaining clean data.
4. **Process development** — Documenting and systematizing repeatable processes.

---

## Growth Areas

### Team Goals
- Growing capabilities in Google Tag Manager (GTM)
- Deepening GA4 knowledge and usage
- Improving Google Search Console utilization
- Advancing email marketing skills
- Building stronger data and dashboard visualization practices

### My Personal Goals
- AI adoption — implementing AI into my own workflows and helping my team do the same.

---

## Memory Protocol

After every session where I provide corrections or feedback:

1. **Corrections** → Append to `memory/corrections.md` with date, context, and the rule to follow going forward.
2. **Preferences** → Append to `memory/preferences.md` with date and the discovered preference.
3. **Project decisions** → Append significant decisions to `memory/project-log.md` with date and rationale.

Format for memory entries:

```markdown
### [YYYY-MM-DD] — Brief Description
- **Context:** What was happening
- **Learning:** What to do differently / what to remember
- **Files Updated:** List of any skill, context, or system files modified as a result
```

---

## Continuous Improvement Protocol — CRITICAL

Logging corrections to memory files is not enough. **The system must improve at the source.**

When I correct an output, provide new information, or Claude discovers something through execution that conflicts with or is missing from existing files, Claude must:

### 1. Update the Relevant Source File(s)

| What happened | What to update |
|---|---|
| A skill produced a wrong approach or missed a step | Update the skill file in `/skills/` with the correction |
| A compliance issue was missed or a new compliance rule is learned | Update `context/compliance-guidelines.md` AND the compliance rules in this `CLAUDE.md` file |
| Brand voice, tone, or positioning was corrected | Update the relevant file in `/brands/` |
| A template produced the wrong structure or format | Update the template in `/templates/` |
| A routing decision was wrong (wrong skill loaded, wrong brand context) | Update the routing tables in this `CLAUDE.md` file |
| A new tool, integration, or platform quirk is discovered | Update `context/tech-stack.md` |
| A new preference about how I like things done is discovered | Update `memory/preferences.md` AND the relevant skill file if it affects execution |
| A correction applies to how the system itself operates | Update this `CLAUDE.md` file directly |

### 2. Always Do Both

- **Log it** in the appropriate `memory/` file (so there's a changelog of what changed and why)
- **Fix it at the source** in the relevant skill, context, template, or system file (so the correction is permanent)

### 3. Tell Me What Changed

After making any file updates, briefly state:
- Which file(s) were updated
- What was changed
- Why (reference the correction or learning)

This ensures I can review changes and the system stays transparent.

### 4. When in Doubt, Ask

If a correction is ambiguous — meaning it could be a one-time preference vs. a permanent rule — ask me before updating a source file. Frame it as:

> "Should I make this a permanent rule in [file name], or was this a one-time adjustment?"

### The Goal

Every correction should only need to happen once. If I fix something today, the system should produce the correct output tomorrow without me having to correct it again.

---

## Execution Protocol

For every request, follow this sequence:

1. **Read this file** (CLAUDE.md) to understand the full system.
2. **Identify the task type** using the routing table above.
3. **Load the relevant skill file(s)** from `/skills/`.
4. **Determine if brand context is needed** and load the appropriate brand directory.
5. **Check `memory/corrections.md` and `memory/preferences.md`** for relevant past learnings.
6. **Execute** using the frameworks and structures defined in the loaded skill files.
7. **Run compliance check** if the output is client-facing or advisor-facing.
8. **Present the output** and ask for feedback.
9. **If corrections or new learnings arise**, follow the Continuous Improvement Protocol:
   - Update the relevant source file(s) (skills, context, templates, brands, or CLAUDE.md)
   - Log the change in the appropriate `memory/` file
   - Tell me what was changed and why
